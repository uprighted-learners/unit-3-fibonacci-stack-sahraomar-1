# Instructions

## Fibonacci Stack

In this lab we will be building out a program that prints out the first 10 numbers in the [fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) `0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34` using an array as a [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)).

The fibonacci sequence is the result of starting with two numbers, zero and one, then adding two numbers to generate the next number in the series.

```js
[0, 1]
0 + 1 = 1

[0, 1, 1]
1 + 1 = 2

[0, 1, 1, 2]
1 + 2 = 3

[0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
2 + 3 = 5

[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
3 + 5 = 6
```

And so on ... onto infinity.

## Objective

### Learning

In this lab, we will be practicing writing functions using arrays, array methods and loops.

Topics

- [Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)
- [`while` loops](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while)
- Array methods [`.push()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push), [`.pop()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop), and [`.length`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/length)

### Achieving

In this lab we will create a piece of software that prints out the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence `0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34`.

## Procedure


### Create the `series` variable

- [x] Initialize a global variable named `series` and assign it the value of an array containing the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence (`0` and `1`).

### Create the `while` loop

- [ ] Set up a `while` loop that will run while our `series.length` is less than 10 and will exit once it is greater
- [ ] Within the `while` loop's code block call the `.pop()` method on our array twice and assign each call to `.pop()` to a variable.
- [ ] Within the `while` loop's code block initialize a variable named `sum` which will be the sum of the two values we just popped.
- [ ] Within the `while` loop's code block call the `.push()` method on our array adding back on the two values we popped and their sum.

### Create the `console.log()`

- [ ] After the `while` loop's code block print the value of our `series` array and check that we're getting the Fibonacci sequence

## Review

In this lab, we practiced using arrays, array methods and while loops to write a function which returns the Fibonacci sequence. The software should:

- Begin with an array of 0 and 1.
- Use a `while` loop to continuously manipulate the array using `.push()` and `.pop()`.
- Stop the loop when our array length is greater than 10.
- Print the Fibonacci sequence to the console.

### Going Further

- How could we extend this program so it prints the first 100 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence?
- How could we print the sequence in a nicer format?
- What if we wanted to allow the user to determine how many Fibonacci numbers to calculate?
- What if you could allow the first two numbers to be something other than [0, 1] ?
